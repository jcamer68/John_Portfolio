## Project 1 - Housing Price Predictor: Project Overview 

- Determined housing prices in Australia based on various categorical and numerical data inputs
- Created four regression models to predict the sale price of houses (Support Vector, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Calculated and plotted respective Mean Absolute Errors (MAEs) for each model, with the XGBoost Regressor model achieving the lowest error

## Project 2 - NBA Exploratory Analysis: Project Overview

- Conducted an exploratory analysis on NBA data to practice manipulating and sorting through large datasets and answer various questions
- Looked at data ranging from geographic features (Players by states, International players by country etc.), to physical characteristics (changes in height and weight by position and decade) and in-game stats (rising popularity of the 3 point shot over the years)
- Experimented with visualizing this data using plotly, matplotlib, and basic DataFrames from Pandas
